title: Start a new automation task
description: |-
  Start a new lead scraping automation task. The task runs in the background
  and scrapes Google Maps for businesses matching your criteria.

  **How it works:**
  1. Provide an industry keyword (e.g., "restaurants", "gyms")
  2. Specify one or more locations to search
  3. Optionally set a limit per location

  The task will run asynchronously and you can monitor its progress
  using the `/automation/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint.
